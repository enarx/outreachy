#### Small brief about technologies Used:

In order to build microservices, Dapr is a versatile framework. Containers are required to initialise Dapr, here we are using Docker.

A WebAssembly VM, like WasmEdge, provides a secure and high-performance runtime for microservices.

WebAssembly-based microservices can be written in a number of programming languages, including Rust, C/C++, Swift, and JavaScript.

WebAssembly programs are embedded into Dapr sidecar applications and are therefore portable and agnostic to Dapr host environments.

A WasmEdge SDK makes it easy to create Tensorflow inference microservices.

WasmEdge is a Kubernetes compatible runtime and could play an important role as a lightweight container alternative to run microservices.

Wasm is an opportunity make more efficient, powerful, fast applications. Daily alot of Contributors are making a really good progress. Let's make much more interesting and cool applications using WebAssembly to make it more fun!

This ML model was created by Second State team. Do check their cool developments on their [github](https://github.com/second-state).
