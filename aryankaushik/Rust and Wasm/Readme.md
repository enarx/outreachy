Hi Folks, Welcome to another Blog. Today, we'll learn about how to call a rust program using Wasm.

Getting Started:

#### 1. We need rust and wasm-pack in our system, lets install them:



a. For Rust

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
b. For wasm-pack

```
cargo install wasm-pack
```

> 
Cargo is a Rust package manager. Cargo downloads your Rust package's dependencies, compiles your packages, makes distributable packages, and uploads them to crates.io, the Rust community's package registry.





#### 2. Create a Library, here I've named it 
` "ary-kaush"`

```
cargo new --lib ary-kaush
```


![3](https://www.wasm.builders/remoteimages/uploads/articles/7u7tzi2k9uj6ynp7syr5.png)

#### 3. Move to the library, 
`cd ary-kaush/`


![4](https://www.wasm.builders/remoteimages/uploads/articles/bvsn2p8o8pnxipd4k2v5.png)

and open vs code by using `code .` command.

we can see that there is a folder named src and a file named cargo.toml.

#### 4. In order to create a wasm module, we need to specify the type of package.
For adding such specification we need to modify `Cargo.toml` file. By adding:
a. crate type:
```
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
```
b. dependancies:

```
wasm-bindgen = "0.2.78"
```

#### 5. Change default code in src/lib.rs to the code that we wan't to run 

> 
here we are making a function to add two numbers.


![5](https://www.wasm.builders/remoteimages/uploads/articles/lsnfhzgrvnmifytk38gn.png)

#### 6. Now building the package

```
wasm-pack build
```

![6](https://www.wasm.builders/remoteimages/uploads/articles/943n8ti76s30mb7g4pmf.png)

after build, a lot of files has been created to support the package.

#### 7. In order to run this program, run:

```
wasm-pack build --target nodjs
```

A pkg folder will be created which includes .wasm,.ts, js and .json files.

#### 8. To run our program we need to create a index.js file and where we will make a math library.

```
const math  = require('./ary_kaush.js')

console.log(math.add2numbers(10,20));
```
In VScode

![8.1](https://www.wasm.builders/remoteimages/uploads/articles/vgtkgklsoiyyhriog34c.png)

#### 9. move in pkg by `cd pkg/` and run 

```
node index.js
```
![8](https://www.wasm.builders/remoteimages/uploads/articles/nfhc8b4hbgf48inez6cb.png)

and Finally we have the required output.

This was a basic program in rust, whereas we can create multiple projects e.g. a calculator, fibonacci series, to find whether the number is prime or not etc. .
