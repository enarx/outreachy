
## BASICS OF CONFIDENTIAL COMPUTING

### WHAT IS CONFIDENTIAL COMPUTING?
Confidential computing is the protection of data in use using hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEE). 
A Trusted Execution Environment is commonly defined as an environment that provides a level of assurance of data integrity, data confidentiality, and code integrity. A hardware-based TEE uses hardware-backed techniques to provide increased security guarantees for the execution of code and protection of data within that environment. (Confidential Computing Consortium) 


### HOW CONFIDENTIAL COMPUTING WORKS? 
Confidential computing protects data and applications by running them in secure enclaves that isolate the data and code to prevent unauthorized access, even when the compute infrastructure is compromised. Intel® SGX technology represents one of the leading implementations of Confidential Computing. Using Intel® SGX allows organizations to isolate the software and data from the underlying infrastructure (hardware or OS) by means of hardware-level encryption.
Implication: Organizations can now run sensitive applications and data on untrusted infrastructure, public clouds, and all other hosted environments. This gives organizations greater control over the security and privacy of applications and data inside and outside of their established security perimeter. 


### BENEFITS
- Secure intellectual property. 
- Protect data and applications in use. 
 
 
### USE CASES
- Prevent fraud in financial services
- Secure and anonymous analytics on multiple data sets
- Detect or develop cure for diseases in the healthcare industry
