  Emscripten is based on  LLVM compiler toolchain. It takes a high-level language (e.g. C++, Rust) and compiles it to a number of architecture-specific binaries.Â The LLVM  introduces an intermediate language (IR) and allows a more pluggable architecture with multiple language front-ends, and architecture-specific back-ends.
  
  Emscripten compiles C and C++ to WebAssembly using LLVM and Binaryen. Emscripten mostly focuses on compiling C and C++ using Clang. Emscripten output can run on the Web, in Node.js, and in wasm runtimes.
