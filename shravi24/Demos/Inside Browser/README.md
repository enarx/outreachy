WebAssembly is designed to complement and run alongside JavaScript â€” using the WebAssembly JavaScript APIs, you can load WebAssembly modules into a JavaScript app and share functionality between the two, which in turn allows you to run programs from different languages inside the browser. This allows you to take advantage of WebAssembly's performance and power and JavaScript's expressiveness and flexibility in the same apps, even if you don't know how to write WebAssembly code.

Inside the browser demos, we run C, C++ and Rust programs with the use of WASM and render them in the browser using JavaScript & HTML.
