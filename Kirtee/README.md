# Enarx With Webassembly.

[Enarx](https://enarx.dev/) Cloud Native, Hardware Neutral and provides runtime TEE(Trusted Execution Environments), based on a [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) and [wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/), allowing developers to deploy applications without any rewrites from languages like Rust, C/C++, C#, Go, Java, Python, Haskell, Grain and many more.

In this documentation i'll be demonstrating how webassembly is used to compile high level languages so mentioned above  and later how to run them on Enarx.

## Why WebAssembly?

The question instead could have been why not webassembly!</br>
WebAssembly (or Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages.
All major browsers support Wasm. The benefits of WebAssembly include:
- **Fast, efficient and portable:** WebAssembly code can be executed at near-native speed across different platforms.
- **Readable and debuggable:** WebAssembly is a low-level assembly language, but it has a human-readable text format
- **Secure:** WebAssembly is specified to be run in a safe, sandboxed execution environment.
- **Part of the open web platform:** It is designed to maintain the versionless, feature-tested, and backwards-compatible nature of the web.
WebAssembly is an exciting technology for deploying highly secure, performant, and portable code.
