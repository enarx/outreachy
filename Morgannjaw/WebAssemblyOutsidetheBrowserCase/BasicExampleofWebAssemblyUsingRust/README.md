# Basic Example – Web assembly Using Rust.  

For this tutorial we are going to use MacOS, Visual Studio Code ( or any text editor of your choice) and of course,  Rust. So we will need to install Rust from its [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).We will also make use of the Clone the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/blob/main/README.md) as the  code makes use of the ```../fundamentals/add``` file. 
 I recommend using  VsCode as your text editor and you’ll install some tools on your machine that will allow you to compile and interprete WebAssembly modules. These tools include:
 
 ## Prerequisites.

####	WebAssembly Binary Toolkit (WABT)

The WebAssembly Binary Toolkit (pronounced “wabbit”) is a general-purpose set of command-line tools you’ll use for building, examining, and troubleshooting WebAssembly modules.  First, you’re going to need to install is CMake.5 using [this link](https://tudat.tudelft.nl/installation/setupDevMacOs.html). Installing CMake varies widely across operating systems, so you’ll need to check the instructions specific to your OS. Come back and continue with the wabt installation once you’ve verified that CMake is up and running locally. Next, follow the instructions on the wabt [GitHub repository README](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/blob/main/README.md) to complete the installation.

#### Extensions in VSCode.
-	```rust-analyzer```: for autocomplete and other great features.
-	```Code-LLDB```: For debugging with LLDB (even works on Windows)
-	```WebAssembly by the WebAssembly foundation```: Allows you to disassemble and inspect .wasm binaries.

#### Cargo.

If you don’t have cargo installed follow [this link](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) to install rust as cargo comes along with it.

#### Wasmtime.
To run your WebAssembly code out from a browser, you will need a runtime called ```wasmtime```. In Linux distributions and macOS, just run this command, follow the steps and the installations should go well.
``` curl <https://wasmtime.dev/install.sh> -sSf | bash```

### Getting Started with Rust.

We shall create a simple addition program. To get started, create a new binary Rust project with the following command: 

  ``` cargo new --bin wasmi_add```

This creates a new standalone binary Rust project that can be executed from the command line. The first step is to add a dependency on the wasmi crate to the project:
 
 ```wasmi_add/Cargo.toml```

 ``` 
[package]
name = "wasmi_add"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Address <you@address.com>"]

[dependencies]
wasmi = "0.4.0"
```

Slowly replace your default main.rs with the following code. 
The first thing you’ll do is load the WebAssembly module (add.wasm) into a vector of bytes (the u8 type) and create a Module from that buffer:

  ```wasmi_add/src/main.rs```

```
extern crate wasmi;
use std::error::Error;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Read;
use wasmi::{ImportsBuilder, ModuleInstance, NopExternals, RuntimeValue};
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<Error>> {
    let mut buffer = Vec::new();
    {
        let mut f = File::open("../fundamentals/add.wasm")?;
        f.read_to_end(&mut buffer)?;
    }
    let module = wasmi::Module::from_buffer(buffer)?;
```

Next, we’ll create an instance of the module. You can think of this as a “running copy” of the module, which has its own state and memory. As a host, the module instance is what you’ll interact with most of the time:

```wasmi_add/src/main.rs```

```
let instance = ModuleInstance::new(&module, &ImportsBuilder::default())
        .expect("Failed to instantiate WASM module")
        .assert_no_start();
```

This code creates a new module with a default set of imports, meaning we’re not satisfying any imports demanded by the module yet. The ```assert_no_start()``` function gives us an executable module instance that will panic if the module has a ```start()``` function. If we knew our module needed initialization, we’d call the ```run_start()``` function instead. The use of ```expect()``` is just another way of forcing a panic if we get a failing result.
Now that we’ve got a module instance, we can invoke a function. As a refresher, here’s what our ```add()``` function looked like:

```
(module
    (func $add (param $lhs i32) (param $rhs i32) (result i32)
        (i32.add
            (get_local $lhs)
            (get_local $rhs)
        )
    )
    (export "add" (func $add))
)
```

## Hosting Modules Outside the Browser

This code takes two ```i32``` parameters and returns an ```i32``` value. We execute that using the wasmi crate like so:

```wasmi_add/src/main.rs```

``` 
let mut args = Vec::<RuntimeValue>::new();
    args.push(RuntimeValue::from(42));
    args.push(RuntimeValue::from(1));

    let result: Option<RuntimeValue> = instance.invoke_export("add", &args, &mut NopExternals)?;
```
Here you call ```invoke_export()``` with the name of the exported function. This name must match and is case-sensitive. The ```RuntimeValue``` is used as a way of converting from Rust-native data types into values that can be passed onto the WebAssembly stack as function parameters. It’s an ```enum```, and as such, it’s incredibly easy to use pattern matching to extract results from, as shown in
the rest of the code from ```main.rs```:

``` wasmi_add/src/main.rs```

```
match result {
        Some(RuntimeValue::I32(v)) => {
            println!("The answer to your addition was {}", v);
        }
        Some(_) => {
            println!("Got a value of an unexpected data type");
        }
        None => {
            println!("Failed to get a result from wasm invocation");
        }
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

There are a couple of places in this code that are more verbose than they needed to be, but it helps to see how everything works in long form before
taking some shortcuts. When you run this code, you should see that it performs the addition just the way you’d expect:


``` Morgans-MacBook-Pro:wasmi_add neo$ cargo run```

And just like that, you’ve created a Rust console application that hosts a WebAssembly module
